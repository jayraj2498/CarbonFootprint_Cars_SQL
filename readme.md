# CO2 Emission by Cars SQL Project


This SQL project aims to analyze a dataset containing information about CO2 emissions from various car models. The dataset includes details such as the car's make, model, engine size, fuel consumption in the city and highway, and CO2 emissions.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to perform comprehensive analysis and gain insights into CO2 emissions from different car models and brands.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following columns:
- MODELYEAR: The year of the model.
- MAKE: The brand or manufacturer of the car.
- MODEL: The specific model of the car.
- VEHICLECLASS: The class of the vehicle.
- ENGINESIZE: The size of the car's engine.
- CYLINDERS: The number of cylinders in the engine.
- TRANSMISSION: The type of transmission.
- FUELTYPE: The type of fuel used.
- FUELCONSUMPTION_CITY: The fuel consumption in the city (in liters per 100 km).
- FUELCONSUMPTION_HWY: The fuel consumption on the highway (in liters per 100 km).
- FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB: The combined fuel consumption (in liters per 100 km).
- FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB_MPG: The combined fuel consumption in miles per gallon.
- CO2EMISSIONS: The CO2 emissions (in grams per kilometer) produced by the car.

## Usage
To replicate the results of this project, execute the provided SQL queries against the dataset. Ensure proper access to the database containing the dataset before running the queries.
